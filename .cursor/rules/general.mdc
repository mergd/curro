This is a repo with convex, Nextjs 15, React 19, and convex auth.

When starting off, run `pnpm run auth:setup` to setup jwt.

If the app is not related to blogging, feel free to remove a lot of the code related to mdx and the blog.

Remove the boilerplate around the notes logic - that's only there as examples.

When importing convex - use @/ instead of a long relative path.

For pageProps with dynamic routes - this is next 15, so make sure to mark these as a promise

Make sure to have a good skeleton.
