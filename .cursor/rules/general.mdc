This is a repo with convex, Nextjs 15, React 19, and convex auth.

When starting off, run `pnpm run auth:setup` to setup jwt.

If the app is not related to blogging, feel free to remove a lot of the code related to mdx and the blog.

Remove the boilerplate around the notes logic - that's only there as examples.
